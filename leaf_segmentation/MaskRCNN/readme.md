# Leaf Segmentation

### By Metaport MaskRCNN
1. Prepare Image dataset
  - convert mask image -> COCO annotation -> VGG annotation

2. training with tensorboard
  -  https://github.com/lazybuttrying/AI_Project/blob/main/leaf_segmentation/MaskRCNN/training.ipynb
3. result
  - Loss Graph is on svg file
  - inference https://github.com/lazybuttrying/AI_Project/blob/main/leaf_segmentation/MaskRCNN/result/result_of_30_epochs.ipynb
